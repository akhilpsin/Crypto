USP:Talegaon is well connected with Mumbai highway, which is considered as a vital part of Pune.
Being surrounded by entertainment and shopping malls, the area also serves other social amenities such as a hospital, schools, and colleges at a very small radius, which makes the life easier and convenient for all the people living around the area. The area boasts the lowest property prices in the area and thus is becoming a residential hub.

The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation and the Pune Municipal Corporation are set to roll out the Pune Ring Road plan to help decongest traffic for Kharadi and Mundhwa.
Mundhwa is emerging as one of the prime residential feeder locations for the business district of Kharadi with natural beauty in its surrounding.
The flyover planned near Mundhwa and the road planned behind Ghorpadi, will give the residents of Mundhwa a direct access to Magarpatta City and M.G.Road.
The 0.75 km bridge that is planned to be built over the Mula-Mutha river by the Pune Municipal corporation and the state authorities will connect Mundhwa to Kharadi in a jiffy, thus creating a greater demand for housing in the Mundhwa area.
The elevated corridor 2 of the proposed Pune Metro project Phase 1 will connect Ramwadi to Vanaz via Mangalwar Peth and Deccan Gymkhana with an extension to Kharadi and will lead Mundhwa to easy connectivity with the key nodes of the city.

USP:Kharadi is in the suburb of Pune with many reputed companies and IT giants in various verticals. Pune's real estate arena is witnessing enormous construction activities as its property market has always been at the top of investment opportunity watch-list of the potential homebuyers looking for suitably priced complexes in Kharadi. This trend is also due to factors like good connectivity with all the public transit systems. These positive notions in the city have made it a preferable place to invest and reside in.

Talegaon is situated on the Mumbai-Pune Highway and enjoys favorable connectivity. As a result many companies have swooped down to invest in Talegaon. Investment by these companies has created a large employment base spurring the demand for homes. The Chakan MIDC has become a favored destination for MNCs like GM, Fox Conn, etc.
Talegaon is around 30 minutes away from Hinjewadi the major IT hub of Pune approx 20 km making Talegaon a hot residential destination among IT professionals.
Talegaon proximity to Mumbai via the Mumbai-Pune expressway and the old Mumbai-Pune highway gives Talegaon a major advantage in the Pune real estate market.
Given this the pollution free climate and scant population make it a very attractive getaway. Increase in residential societies has generated development of malls, schools and hospitals at Talegaon.

Chikhali is an upcoming locality in North Pune and is witnessing demand for smaller units of 1 and 2 BHK apartments. Mostly the demand comes from middle-class buyers who prefer lower priced and budgeted apartments.
Even the developers, who have realized the potential of this locality are coming up with maximum number of smaller units.
Chikhali is very well connected to other parts of city, via trains, buses and other public transports.
The basic needs like schools, banks, ATMs, hospitals and market are found in very close proximity.
